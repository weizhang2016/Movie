    <p align="center" style="color:white;"> <i>Under Sandet</i> (English: Land of Mine) is a 2015 Danish-German historical drama film directed by Martin Zandvliet. The film is inspired by real events, that is barely described in history books and tells the story of German POWs sent to clear mines in Denmark after World War II. It is believed that more than 2,000 German soldiers were forced to remove mines, and nearly half of them lost their lives or limbs.</p>
